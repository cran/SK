Description: Segment-based Kriging methods, including segment-based ordinary 
             Kriging (SOK) and segment-based regression Kriging (SRK) for 
             spatial prediction of line segment spatial data as described in 
             Yongze Song (2018) <doi:10.1109/TITS.2018.2805817>. Includes the 
             spatial prediction and spatial visualisation. The descriptions of 
             the methods and case datasets refer to the citation information 
             below.
